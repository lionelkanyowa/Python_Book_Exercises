# Q.10 Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order. Without running the code, can
# you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

names = {
    'Chris', 'Claire', 'Karis', 'Karl', 'Max' 'Nick', 'Victor'}

print(names)

# This code may print in the order but that is not guaranteed since sets are types that maintain an unordered
# collection. So printing an ordered set is very rare.
