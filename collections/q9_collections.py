my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, [4, 5, 6]]
another_list = list(my_list)

# Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list equal?
# Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list the same object?
# Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list equal?
# Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list the same object?

# Don't Write any code for this exercise

# They are equal because they are identical
# No they are different objects
# Yes they are equal, they are identical and contain the same elements
# The lists are the same object because the list constructor performs a shallow copy.
